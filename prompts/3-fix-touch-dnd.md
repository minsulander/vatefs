I tried drag-and-drop in chrome devtools iPad emulation mode, didn't work. This app needs to work well on an iPad. 
Let's fix touch drag-and-drop. 

In the emulator, if I press and hold on a strip for about half a second, a context menu appears and the "drag clone" of the strip gets stuck, with no way of getting rid of it short of reloading the app.. maybe this doesn't happen on a real iPad device but it's still annoying for development. Let's fix it.
