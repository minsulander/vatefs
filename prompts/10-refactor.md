We've come a long way in this project. Now it's time to clean things up a bit. 
Look through the code base and try to find things to refactor and simplify. Remove any redundant code or mock data. 
Some files have grown pretty large. Maybe structure things a bit more by making logical splits.
Focus on backend, frontend, and the communication interfaces/shared common code between them.
Exclude the euroscope plugin, no changes allowed there. 
Also update the CLAUDE.md file with any relevant information for future success.
