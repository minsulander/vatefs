This project is currently a scaffold for a VATSIM EFS (Electronic Flight Strip) solution, implemented as a web application and companion EuroScope plugin, intended to run locally on a Windows machine running EuroScope as the main ATC client.

We're going to start with implementing a prototype of the frontend, ignoring the backend and EuroScope integration for now.

Under @/frontend/ we have a scaffold for a Vue 3/Vite/Pinia/Vuetify project.
Let's use that for implementing a prototype with mock data, containing flight strips, bays, sections, resembling the [Saab EFS system](https://www.saab.com/products/electronic-flight-strips-EFS). More info on flight strips in general can be found at [skybrary](https://skybrary.aero/articles/flight-progress-strips). The prototype should include interactions for moving the strips between bays/sections (drag-and-drop, or click left edge to move to "next section"). Logic for which section is "next" can be implemented later. Also, the end product should have auto-sorting logic (typically on departure/arrival time etc, which we can implement later) but the user should be able to manually change flight strip sorting within a section. The end product needs to have a highly configurable layout (with regards to bays, sections etc). Let's not build any UI for that configuration now, but configuration data should live in Pinia stores. Mock data should also come from Pinia stores, as we'll implement future integration in stores. 

Visually, the prototype should resemble the Saab system, like ![this image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkkd45ayz/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_auto,q_auto,fl_progressive/w_600,h_336,c_scale/saab/32663) or ![this](https://res.cloudinary.com/dkkd45ayz/image/upload/f_auto,dpr_auto,q_auto,fl_progressive/w_600,h_363,c_scale/saab/32661), with 4 vertical bays, sections bay 1: "ARRIVALS", "RUNWAY 34R/34L", bay 2: "PENDING DEP", "RUNWAY 34L/34R", bay 3: "AIRBORNE", "TAXI ARR", bay 4: "TRANSIT", "SAFEGUARD", "VFR", "TAXI DEP".

Most importantly, at this stage, the prototype should be interactive, front-end only, for testing the interactions and component layout. I'm envisioning components such as FlightStrip.vue, Bay.vue, Section.vue with well defined props etc, but you're free to make your own decisions. If a well-established third-party dependency, e.g. some library from npm for drag-and-drop interaction etc, is required that may be added but I would prefer to keep dependency count to a minimum.
